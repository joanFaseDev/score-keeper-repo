Here's a small project built as part of an Udemy Course by Colt Steele (if anyone's interested, i leave the link at the bottom of that file). It's a very tiny ping-pong game where the main goal was to get accustomed with events to build an app with some interactions in it. I really liked that exercice because i got to work on equal part HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I tried to work with some CSS mechanisms i'm not used to like vh units and pseudo class :not(). 

My three biggest regrets on that project are:
* the app is not responsive, i wanted an app functionnal and visually decent so working with flexbox and media queries wasn't my priorities here
* i didn't fixed the small problem where you can basically add a point without choosing a win condition and end the game (ok that's not small but it's Sunday 6pm and i feel pretty lazy now!)
* i tried to play with background-images and linear-gradient and... well let's say the result isn't quite what i had in mind. I learned a lot though so that's good!
